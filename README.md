# BitTorrent Client — Java, Multithreading, Networking, System Design
- Implemented a simplified BitTorrent client from scratch to explore distributed systems and concurrency concepts.
- Followed the BitTorrent protocol for peer communication, piece selection, and file assembly.

- Built two models:
  - **Single-peer model**: Downloaded files from a single peer to establish baseline functionality.
  - **Multi-peer model**: Extended design to coordinate with multiple peers concurrently using multithreading and concurrency concepts.

- Gained hands-on experience with socket programming, protocol design, and system scalability.
- Currently extending the system with advanced algorithms for peer selection, piece prioritization, and fault tolerance.
